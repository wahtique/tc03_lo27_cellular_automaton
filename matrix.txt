We define the type Matrix, and every types associated as follow :

Let cellElement = colIndex x rowIndex x value x nextCol x nextRow with
	colIndex : an integer indicating in which column of the Latrix this element is
	rowIndex : an integer indicating in which row this element is located
	nextCol : a pointer toward the next element on the row 
	newtRow : a pointer toward the next element on this column

Let rowElement = rowN x nextRow x prevRow x row with
	rowN : an integer, the index of the row represented by this rowElement
	nextRow : a pointer toward the next rowElement, or NULL if last row, in the Matrix
	prevRow : a pointer toward the previous rowElement in the Matrix, or NULL if it's the first row
	row : a pointer toward the first cellElement of the row

Let colElement = colN x nextCol x prevCol x col with
	colN : an integer, the index of the column represented by this colElement
	nextCol : a pointer toward the next colElement in the Matrix, or NULL if it's the last column
	prevCol : a pointer toward the previous colElement in the Matrix, or NULL if it's the first column
	col : a pointer toward the first cellElement of the column

Let Matrix = colCount x rowCount x cols x rows with
	colcount : integer indicating the number of columns the Matrix contains
	rowCount : integer indicating the number of rows the Matrix contains
	cols : a pointer toward the first element of the list of colElement representing the columns of the Matrix
	rows : a pointer toward the first element of the list of rowElement representing the rows of the Matrix

Let arrayMatrix = mat x n x p with
	mat : 1 dimensional matrix of dots, representing the ones in our matrix

Let points = x x y with
	x : integer, the row
	y : intger, the col
