# Cellular Automaton 

by Yann Le Chevanton and William Veal Phan, then students at the University of Technology of Belfort-Montb√©liard.
Project made for the course LO27, Fall semester of 2016. 

We implemented cellular automatons described in this paper : https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0804/0804.2346.pdf
using basic C and a way to complex data structure for our own good (thx teach').

Compiled with gcc (thx teach' again).
